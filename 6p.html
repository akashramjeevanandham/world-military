<h1> TYPES OF MILITARY SERVICES</h1>
<h1><a href="7p.html">1)Air Force and Air Force Reserve:</a></h1>
<h3>The nation's source of air and space power. The primary mission of the USAF is to fly planes, helicopters, and satellites.</h3>

<h1><a href="8p.html">2)Navy and Navy Reserve:</a></h1>
<h3>The Navy accomplishes its missions primarily by sea, but also by air and land. It secures and protects the oceans around the world to create peace and stability, making the seas safe for travel and trade.</h3>
<h1><a href="9p.html">3)Army and Army Reserve(infantry):</a></h1>
<h3>The dominant land power. The Army generally moves in to an area, secures it, and instills order and values before it leaves. It also guards U.S. installations and properties throughout the world.</h3>
<h1>4)Army National Guard:</h1>
<h3>The Army National Guard is an elite group of warriors who dedicate a portion of their time to serving their nation. Each state has its own Guard, as required by the Constitution; in fact, it is the only branch of the military whose existence is actually required by the Constitution.</h3>

<h1>5)Coast Guard and Coast Guard Reserve:</h1>
<h3>The Coast Guard's mission is primarily with domestic waterways. The Coast Guard does rescues, law enforcement, drug prevention, and clears waterways.</h3>

<h1>6)Marine Corps and Marine Corps Reserve:</h1>
<h3>The Marine Corps is known as the U.S.' rapid-reaction force. They are trained to fight by sea and land, and usually are the first "boots on the ground." Marines are known as the world's fiercest warriors.</h3>

<h1>7)Air National Guard:</h1>
<h3>The Air National Guard as we know it today is a separate reserve component of the United States Air Force.</h3>


<h1>8)Space Force:</h1>
<h3>The newest branch of the military, the U.S. Space Force was signed into law in December, 2019. The Space Force currently does not have a reserve component. The sixth branch of the military, the Space Force is also still in development and will be for some time as many final decisions are made, including uniforms, basing and even recruitment.</h3>
